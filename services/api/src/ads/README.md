# Non-Intrusive Advertising System

This module implements a privacy-first advertising system for the Otsukai DX platform, designed to generate revenue while maintaining an excellent user experience and respecting user privacy.

## üéØ Privacy-First Principles

### ‚úÖ What We Track (Minimal Data)
- **Ad impressions** - When ads are shown (with optional user/group context)
- **Ad slot placement** - Where ads are displayed (list_top, detail_bottom)
- **Creative performance** - Which ads perform best (aggregated data only)

### ‚ùå What We DON'T Track
- ‚ùå Cross-site tracking or cookies
- ‚ùå Detailed user profiling or behavioral analysis
- ‚ùå Personal information in ad targeting
- ‚ùå Location-based ad targeting
- ‚ùå Purchase history for ad targeting
- ‚ùå Social media integration for ads

## üöÄ Features

### Core Advertising Features
- **Two Ad Slots Only** - `list_top` and `detail_bottom` placements
- **One-Ad-Per-Screen Rule** - Never more than one ad visible at a time
- **Frequency Control** - Prevents ad fatigue with cooldown periods
- **Priority-Based Selection** - Weighted ad selection algorithm
- **Daily Impression Limits** - Respects user experience with reasonable limits
- **Anonymous Ad Serving** - Works without user authentication

### Privacy Features
- **Optional User Tracking** - Impression logging works with or without user ID
- **Minimal Data Collection** - Only essential metrics for ad performance
- **No Cross-Site Tracking** - Ads are served from the same domain
- **User Reporting** - Users can report inappropriate ad content
- **Transparent Metrics** - Clear statistics without personal data exposure

### Administrative Features
- **Ad Creative Management** - Create, update, and manage ad content
- **Performance Analytics** - Aggregated statistics and reporting
- **Content Moderation** - Review and manage reported ads
- **Priority Control** - Weighted ad selection based on priority (1-10)
- **Status Management** - Active, paused, and expired ad states

## üîß Usage Examples

### Getting an Ad for Display

```typescript
// Get ad for shopping list top
GET /ads/display/list_top?group_id=group123

Response:
{
  "creative_id": "ad-uuid",
  "title": "Fresh Organic Vegetables",
  "description": "Get 20% off on all organic vegetables this week!",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/ad-image.jpg",
  "click_url": "https://example.com/vegetables",
  "slot": "list_top"
}

// No ad available
Response: 204 No Content
```

### Logging an Ad Impression

```typescript
POST /ads/impression
{
  "creative_id": "ad-uuid",
  "slot": "list_top",
  "group_id": "group123"  // optional
}

Response:
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Creating an Ad Creative (Admin)

```typescript
POST /ads/creatives
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
{
  "title": "Fresh Organic Vegetables",
  "description": "Get 20% off on all organic vegetables this week!",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/ad-image.jpg",
  "click_url": "https://example.com/vegetables",
  "slot": "list_top",
  "priority": 7
}
```

### Reporting Inappropriate Content

```typescript
POST /ads/report
Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
{
  "creative_id": "ad-uuid",
  "reason": "Inappropriate content",
  "details": "Contains offensive material"
}
```

## üé® Ad Slot Specifications

### List Top Slot (`list_top`)
- **Placement**: Top of shopping lists
- **Format**: Native ad card matching list design
- **Frequency**: Maximum 1 per list view
- **Design**: Integrates seamlessly with shopping list items

### Detail Bottom Slot (`detail_bottom`)
- **Placement**: Bottom of item details and purchase modals
- **Format**: Banner advertisement
- **Frequency**: Maximum 1 per modal/detail view
- **Design**: Clear separation from content with subtle styling

## üìä Frequency Control Algorithm

### Daily Limits
- **Maximum 50 impressions per user per day**
- **5-minute cooldown between same ad impressions**
- **Priority-based selection with weighted randomization**

### Selection Logic
1. Filter active ads for the requested slot
2. Check user's daily impression limit (if authenticated)
3. Remove recently shown ads (within cooldown period)
4. Select ad using weighted priority algorithm
5. Fall back to oldest impression if all ads recently shown

### Priority Weighting
```typescript
// Priority 1-10 scale
// Higher priority = more likely to be selected
// Selection uses weighted random algorithm

const totalWeight = ads.reduce((sum, ad) => sum + ad.priority, 0);
let random = Math.random() * totalWeight;

for (const ad of ads) {
  random -= ad.priority;
  if (random <= 0) return ad;
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### AdCreative Model
```prisma
model AdCreative {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  title       String
  description String
  image_url   String
  click_url   String
  slot        String   // list_top, detail_bottom
  priority    Int      @default(5) // 1-10 priority weight
  status      String   @default("active") // active, paused, expired
  created_at  DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at  DateTime @updatedAt

  impressions AdImpression[]
}
```

### AdImpression Model (Minimal Tracking)
```prisma
model AdImpression {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  user_id     String?  // nullable for privacy
  group_id    String?  // nullable for privacy
  slot        String   // list_top, detail_bottom
  creative_id String
  shown_at    DateTime @default(now())

  // Relations (optional for privacy)
  user     User?       @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  group    Group?      @relation(fields: [group_id], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  creative AdCreative  @relation(fields: [creative_id], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```
